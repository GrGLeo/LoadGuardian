# To-Do List for Improvements

## 1. **Code Structure and Organization**
- [ ] Separate the code into multiple files/modules for better readability.
  - [ ] Create a `main.go` file for the entry point.
  - [ ] Move Docker-related operations (e.g., `PullServices`, `CreateAllService`) into a `docker_utils.go` file.
  - [ ] Place YAML parsing logic (`ParseYAML`) in a `config_parser.go` file.
  - [ ] Move container operations (`Start`, `FetchLogs`) into a `container_ops.go` file.
- [ ] Add meaningful comments for each function and type definition.
- [ ] Use interfaces to make components like Docker client easier to mock for testing.

---

## 2. **Error Handling**
- [ ] Improve error handling for Docker API calls.
  - [ ] Add context about the operation in error messages.
  - [ ] Wrap errors using `fmt.Errorf` to provide more context.
  - [ ] Check for specific Docker API error types for better granularity.
- [ ] Ensure all goroutines handle errors gracefully.
  - [ ] Ensure `FetchLogs` sends error messages to the `logChannel` properly.
- [ ] Avoid `log.Fatal` in non-critical paths; return errors instead.

---

## 3. **Logging and Debugging**
- [ ] Replace `fmt.Printf` with a proper logging package (e.g., `logrus` or `zap`).
  - [ ] Use different logging levels (info, debug, error) based on the context.
- [ ] Add logs for each major operation (e.g., pulling an image, creating a container, etc.).
- [ ] Format logs for readability and consistency.

---

## 4. **Concurrency and Goroutines**
- [ ] Use a `sync.WaitGroup` to manage goroutines, especially for log fetching.
- [ ] Add a mechanism to stop goroutines gracefully (e.g., context cancellation).
- [ ] Avoid blocking channels (`logChannel`) without consumer checks.

---

## 5. **Code Reusability**
- [ ] Abstract common operations like starting and fetching logs into reusable utility functions.
- [ ] Add flexibility for creating multiple containers per service.
- [ ] Create helper methods for port and network configurations.

---

## 6. **Config and Validation**
- [ ] Validate YAML configuration before proceeding with operations.
  - [x] Check if all required fields (`image`, `ports`, etc.) are provided.
  - [ ] Provide clear error messages for invalid configurations.
- [ ] Support additional configuration options (e.g., environment variables, restart policies).

---

## 7. **Docker API Enhancements**
- [ ] Add support for specifying container environment variables.
- [ ] Handle cases where the image is already present and doesn't need pulling.
- [ ] Support advanced network configurations (e.g., attaching containers to multiple networks).

---

## 8. **Testing**
- [ ] Write unit tests for each core function.
  - [ ] Mock Docker client for testing API calls.
  - [ ] Test YAML parsing with various valid and invalid configurations.
- [ ] Add integration tests to simulate end-to-end workflows.
- [ ] Use a testing framework (e.g., `testify`) for assertions.

---

## 9. **User Experience**
- [ ] Enhance CLI outputs for better readability.
  - [ ] Use colored and formatted output for status messages.
  - [ ] Add progress indicators for long-running operations.
- [ ] Add support for user-defined container names.
- [ ] Provide meaningful error messages for invalid or missing inputs.

---

## 10. **Performance Optimization**
- [ ] Optimize resource usage by batching operations where possible.
- [ ] Avoid unnecessary API calls (e.g., image pulls for already existing images).
- [ ] Use Docker API pagination for large responses.

---

## 11. **Documentation**
- [ ] Create a README file explaining how to use the tool.
  - [ ] Include example YAML configurations.
  - [ ] Document all supported features and commands.
- [ ] Add inline documentation for public functions and types.
