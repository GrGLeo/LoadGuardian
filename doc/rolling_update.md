### Rolling Update Mechanism Implementation Checklist

#### 1. Pre-Implementation Planning
- [x] Identify the service to be updated.
  - [x] Gather information about the service, such as number of replicas and current configuration.
- [ ] Set up a reliable health check mechanism:
  - [ ] Define health criteria (e.g., response to a specific endpoint or success of a custom script).
  - [ ] Determine a timeout and retry policy for health checks.
- [ ] Plan resource allocation:
  - [ ] Confirm sufficient resources (CPU, memory) are available for additional containers during the update.

#### 2. Implementation: Rolling Update Logic
- **Retrieve Current State**
  - [ ] Fetch the list of running containers for the target service.
  - [ ] Record their identifiers and configurations.

- **Update Containers One by One**
  - **For Each Container:**
    - [ ] Pull the updated image for the service.
      - [ ] Log the image version being used.
    - [ ] Create and start a new container with the updated image:
      - [ ] Apply the same configuration (e.g., ports, environment variables, volume mounts) to the new container.
      - [ ] Assign resource limits (if applicable).
      - [ ] Log the new container ID.
    - [ ] Perform health checks:
      - [ ] Wait for the new container to pass the health check.
      - [ ] Retry if the health check fails (up to the retry limit).
      - [ ] Log health check success or failure.
    - [ ] Redirect traffic (if applicable):
      - [ ] Gradually shift traffic to the new container using a load balancer or similar mechanism.
    - [ ] Stop and remove the old container:
      - [ ] Ensure the old container is not handling active requests before stopping it.
      - [ ] Log the removal of the old container.

- **Handle Multiple Replicas**
  - [ ] Repeat the above process for each replica of the service.
  - [ ] Ensure at least one healthy container is always running to avoid downtime.

#### 3. Post-Update Steps
- [ ] Confirm the state of the service:
  - [ ] Ensure all replicas are running with the updated image.
  - [ ] Verify that all containers pass health checks.
- [ ] Update internal records or data structures:
  - [ ] Replace old container IDs with new ones.
  - [ ] Store metadata about the update (e.g., timestamp, image version).
- [ ] Clean up temporary resources:
  - [ ] Remove unused network configurations or volumes if applicable.
- [ ] Run functional tests:
  - [ ] Test the service end-to-end to ensure it behaves as expected.
  - [ ] Monitor for any performance or stability issues.

#### 4. Monitoring and Validation
- [ ] Set up monitoring for the updated service:
  - [ ] Track container health and logs for errors.
  - [ ] Watch for unexpected resource usage spikes.
- [ ] Validate the update:
  - [ ] Check that all expected functionality is available.
  - [ ] Gather feedback from users or downstream services.
- [ ] Roll back if necessary:
  - [ ] Define a rollback plan before starting the update.
  - [ ] If issues arise, stop updated containers and restart old ones.

#### 5. Documentation
- [ ] Document the update process:
  - [ ] Record steps taken and any challenges encountered.
  - [ ] Note lessons learned for future updates.
- [ ] Communicate the update:
  - [ ] Notify team members or stakeholders about the completed update.
  - [ ] Provide details on the new version and any changes.

#### Optional Enhancements
- [ ] Automate the rolling update process for repeatability.
- [ ] Implement canary deployments to gradually expose a small percentage of users to the updated service before full rollout.
- [ ] Use blue-green deployment strategies if downtime is critical.
- [ ] Set up alerts for failed updates to respond quickly.
